## Introduction

To help introduce the topic I have used some general statistics. They are all available here:

I referred to David Whyte’s Violence of Austerity (2018) in pdf, [available at]:
(https://www.researchgate.net/profile/David_Whyte4/publication/322314292_The_Violence_of_Austerity/links/5a536aa40f7e9bbc10569ef4/The-Violence-of-Austerity.pdf)

I also referred to this parliamentary research briefing (2018) in pdf, [available at:]
(https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN07096/SN07096.pdf)


## The Barnett formula: 

I referred to [this](http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-7386/CBP-7386.pdf) parliamentary research  pdf to discover how much money is allocated to Northern Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England, and how much was spent on education. 

In 2015 there was a parliamentary review, Barnett and beyond: time for a new system for funding devolution? Which was also referred to. [Available at:] (https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/blog/barnett-and-beyond-time-new-system-funding-devolution).



## Teachers: 

To look at the levels of staffing in UK schools, I used the Department for Education’s statistics. 

To find out how many teachers retired, I looked at: GOV.UK. (2018). Teacher to pupil ratio. [Available at:] (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/533618/SFR21_2016_MainText.pdf). 

To find out how many teachers retired, I looked at: GOV.UK. (2018). Initial teacher training performance profiles: 2016 to 2017. [Available at:] (https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/initial-teacher-training-performance-profiles-2016-to-2017). 

To see how popular teaching courses were, I referred to:GOV.UK. (2019). Initial teacher training: trainee number census - 2018 to 2019. [Available at:] (https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/initial-teacher-training-trainee-number-census-2018-to-2019). 

To discover why teachers are flocking overseas I used the biggest employer (COBIS) for UK teachers overseas [survey]:(https://www.cobis.org.uk/cobis-news/final-report-and-case-studies-teacher-supply-in-british-international-schools)

In order to find how much was spent on supply teachers, I looked at Supply Teachers: Expenditure:Written question - 114566, by Anna Turnley from [Redcar:] (https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2017-11-20/114566) 

## Mental Health: 

For statistics of young people diagnosed with mental illness I referred to NHS Digital 2019 records. Specifically, Mental Health of Children and Young People in England, 2017 [PAS]: https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/mental-health-of-children-and-young-people-in-england/2017/2017.

For Wales, I referred to the National Assembly for Wales, Children, Young People and Education Committee, 2014.Inquiry into Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). [Retrieved from] (http:// www.assembly.wales/laid%20documents/cr- ld10016%20-%20report%20by%20the%20 children,%20young%20people%20and%20 education%20committee%20-%20inquiry%20 into%20child%20and%20adolescent%20m- ental%20health/cr-ld10016-e.pdf)

For UK statistics I referred to NSPCC 2015 research. How safe are our children? The most comprehensive overview of child protection in the UK. Retrieved [from] (https://www.nspcc.org.uk/globalassets/documents/research-reports/ how-safe-children-2016-report.pdf).

I also referred to these reports:

## Welfare: 

Referred to this [Institute for Fiscal Studies document] (https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/1718)

This figure assumes that the division of the total cost of child benefit and guardian’s allowance between the two benefits is the same for GB and the UK. [Source: HMRC, Annual Report and Accounts 2015–16,] (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/539608/HMRC_Annual_Report_and_Accounts_2015-16-web.pdf)

The division of the total personal tax credit bill between child and working tax credit assumes the tapering of tax credit entitlement reduces working tax credit before child tax credit. This is consistent with HMRC practice. [Source: HMRC, Annual Report and Accounts 2015–16,] (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/539608/HMRC_Annual_Report_and_Accounts_2015-16-web.pdf). 

This figure assumes that the division of the total tax credit bill between WTC and CTC is the same for GB and the [UK].(

As well as this Office for Budget Responsibility [report] (https://obr.uk/forecasts-in-depth/brief-guides-and-explainers/an-obr-guide-to-welfare-spending/)

## Comparison: 

Welfare relating to children, was available on the ONS [social protection profiles] (https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/governmentpublicsectorandtaxes/publicsectorfinance/articles/howisthewelfarebudgetspent/2016-03-16) With thanks to the ONS for their graphic. 

I also utilised The Treasury's 2019 budget [report](https://www.researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/CBP-8517/CBP-8517.pdf)

I plotted these details every second year to provide a visualisation that shows the cuts that affect children's development.
